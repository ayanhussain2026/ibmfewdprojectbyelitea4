        <p>Our mission is to provide knowledge & awaring students about the benefeciary schemes which are provided by government & various organisations for supporting
            poor & eligible students in providing them better quality education in their life. We have found that a lot of students are not aware about these schemes & due to which they cant able to pursue 
            education in their life & simply waste their carrer. So, for supporting them we are here to help them through the help of 
            this website.

        It is our honor to have the opportunity to assist and support students by informing them about various scholarships 
        and schemes provided by both government and private organizations which they dont know earlier. Through this website, we hope to contribute to 
        their growth and learning, helping them to achieve their educational and career aspirations by finding time to time updates of 
        beneficial schemes. We have add all the informations about the schemes in only one website, with the help of which
        one can able to gather knowledge about scholarship schemes, education loans at low interests, abroad study consultancy, etc. in only one site so that a student can't waste & spend his
        precious time in finding schemes at different-different sites, wasting their time, efforts & get confused.
